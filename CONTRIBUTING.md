# How to contribute

We welcome all contributions to IMDClient!

Contributions can take many forms, such as:

<!-- * sharing bug reports or feature requests through the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/becksteinlab/imdclient/issues) -->
* asking or answering questions, or otherwise joining in on discussions
* adding bug fixes, new features, or otherwise improving the code
* adding or improving documentation

<!-- The second two options both involve making a [pull request](https://github.com/becksteinlab/imdclient/pulls) . -->

There are many existing guides on how to make a contribution to an open
source project on GitHub. In short, the steps are to:

  * Ensure that you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
  * [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository into your own account
  * On your local machine, [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork
  * Create a development environment from source, following the Installation from source instructions
  * Create a new branch off the `main` branch with a meaningful name (e.g. ``git checkout -b fix-issue-39``)
  * Add your modifications to the code or documentation
  * Add tests if modifying the code
  * Commit and push changes to GitHub, and open a pull request
