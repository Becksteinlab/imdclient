    :class:`timeit` is a context manager (to be used with the :keyword:`with`

    Attributes
    ----------
    elapsed : float
        Time in seconds that elapsed between entering
        and exiting the context.

    Example
    -------
    Use as a context manager::

       with timeit() as total:
          # code to be timed
