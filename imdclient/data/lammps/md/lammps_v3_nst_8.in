## Create Box
#Refers to an abstract geometric region of space. units box refers to the fact that the size of the box is specified in the units as given in the units command. 
# The name "forbox" refers to the region ID so that you can refer to it somewhere else in this input script.

# Since we have given fcc as lattice type no need to mention basis for this

## Create atoms & define interactions
# basis arg defines which atoms are created based on their lattice position (all are atom type 1)

# lj potential describes potential energy between two atoms as function of the dist between them

## Create atom group for argon atoms
group ar type 1 #Group all the argon types (argon type is of type 1). All atoms of type 1 are in group with the name 'ar'


## Write initial configuration
dump dump_1 all custom 1 dump_initial_config.dump id type x y z ix iy iz vx vy vz


## Perform energy minimization
run 1
# Stop dumping to this file
undump dump_1 
# Minimize the energy using a conjugate gradient step.
minimize 1e-25 1e-19 10000 10000 
print "Finished Minimizing"

## Output the topology after minimization

# Set the velocities of all the atoms so that the temperature of the system
# is 300K. Make the distribution Gaussian.
