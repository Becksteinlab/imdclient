## Setup
units metal 
boundary p p p #Specify periodic boundary condition are needed in all three faces
atom_style atomic #What style of atoms is to be used in the simulation
log   logfile.txt #Write the log file to this text file. All thermodynamic information applicable to the entire system

## Create Box
#Refers to an abstract geometric region of space. units box refers to the fact that the size of the box is specified in the units as given in the units command. 
# The name "forbox" refers to the region ID so that you can refer to it somewhere else in this input script.

create_box 1 forbox 
# Since we have given fcc as lattice type no need to mention basis for this
lattice fcc 4.58 

## Create atoms & define interactions
# basis arg defines which atoms are created based on their lattice position (all are atom type 1)

# Mass of atom type 1 is 39.48 [mass units grams/mole]

# lj potential describes potential energy between two atoms as function of the dist between them
# don't apply lj interactions beyond cutoff dist
pair_style lj/cut 10 
# The coefficient of the lj potential for the interactions of atom type 1 with atom type 1

## Create atom group for argon atoms
group ar type 1 #Group all the argon types (argon type is of type 1). All atoms of type 1 are in group with the name 'ar'


## Write initial configuration
dump dump_1 all custom 1 dump_initial_config.dump id type x y z ix iy iz vx vy vz


## Perform energy minimization
run 1
# Stop dumping to this file
undump dump_1 
# Minimize the energy using a conjugate gradient step.
minimize 1e-25 1e-19 10000 10000 
print "Finished Minimizing"
variable ener equal pe

## Output the topology after minimization

## Prepare MD simulation
timestep  0.001
# Set the velocities of all the atoms so that the temperature of the system
# is 300K. Make the distribution Gaussian.

# this is equlibration process.
fix 1 all nve

# DCD lines are commented. These lines were used to create the true trajectory

# dump_modify dcd1 unwrap yes

## IMD settings

## Run MD sim
# run with active settings as many runs as required. timestep*No. of. steps =10ps
run 1000 
# undump dcd1 # Stop dumping information to the dump file.
unfix 1
# Unfix the NVE. Additional lines if any will assume that this fix is off.
